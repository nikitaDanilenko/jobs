# The Jobs Puzzle

This project aims at solving the [Jobs Puzzle](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~wos/mathproblems/jobs.html)
in the functional logic programming language [Curry](http://www.curry-language.org) using the
[KiCS2](http://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/kics2) compiler.

The project is a single code file, which is available as

* [Markdown](./Jobs.md) which is suited for viewing it on GitHub
* [Literate Curry](./Jobs.lcurry) which can be loaded directly into KiCS2
